# Binary-Search-Tree
Module 8 assignment

In this assignemnt I was to download and open a prefilled file and go through all FIXME problems using the Binary Seach Tree data structure. 
This type of data structure allows us to maintain a sorted list of numbers, sorting them in a tree like image. When the numbers are being sorted they are evaluated to be sorted right or left. The current number being evaluated is called a root, the following numbers are called leafs. The leafs are compare to the root, if the leaf is greater than the root is it placed on the right side, if the leaf is less than the root it is placed on the right. Through this assignemnt I also used Tree traversals inorder, preorder, and postorder. 

Inorder traveeral give nodes in non-decreasing order.
Preorder traversal is used to create a copy of the tree.
Post order traversal is used to used to delete the tree.

List of FIXME problems

FIXME 1:
I was to initialize housekeep variables by setting root equal to null pointer value (nullptr)

FIXME 2:
Called tree traversal inOrder and passed in root. I also used a while loop to set the order of the node. 

FIXME 3:
Called tree traversal postOder and passed in root. 

FIXME 4:
Called tree traversal preOrder and passed in root.

FIXME 5:
For this problem I was to insert a bit into the binary search tree. I used and if-else statement.
